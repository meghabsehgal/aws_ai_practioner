# D5.2 Compliance and Governance for AI Systems (Domain 5: 14% Exam Weight)

## 1. Governance and Compliance Regulations
[cite_start]AI systems must adhere to various regulatory standards[cite: 209]:
* **Global/Industry Standards:** International Organization for Standardization (ISO), System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports.
* **Algorithm Accountability Laws:** Emerging regulations requiring transparency in AI decision-making.

## 2. AWS Services to Assist with Governance
[cite_start]These services help track and manage compliance status[cite: 210]:
* **AWS Config:** Continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations, helping ensure every resource (e.g., S3 bucket) meets specified compliance rules.
* **AWS Audit Manager:** Automates the collection of evidence for audits, helping you assess risk and demonstrate compliance with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR.
* [cite_start]**AWS Artifact:** Provides on-demand access to AWS's own compliance reports and certifications (e.g., SOC, ISO)[cite: 220].
* **AWS CloudTrail:** Logs all API activity and user actions in your AWS account, providing an audit trail for security and governance investigations.

## 3. Data Governance Strategies
[cite_start]Effective governance is required throughout the data lifecycle[cite: 211, 212]:
* **Data Lifecycles and Retention:** Defining policies for how long data is stored and when it must be deleted.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Continuous observation of model inputs, outputs, and system metrics.
* **Transparency Standards and Review:** Implementing frameworks (like the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix) and review processes to ensure AI policies are followed.
* **Data Residency:** Ensuring data is processed and stored in the required geographic region.
