# D5.1 Security and Governance (Domain 5: 14% Exam Weight)

## 1. Core Concept: The Media Company Analogy 🎬
**Analogy Focus:** Security and Governance represent the **Legal and IT Security Departments**. Their job is to protect the intellectual property (data and models) and ensure all operations follow local laws (compliance).
* **AWS Shared Responsibility Model:** AWS is responsible for the **physical security** of the data center and the foundational infrastructure (**Security *of* the Cloud**). The media company is responsible for **how they configure** the services, encrypt their scripts (data), and manage employee access (**Security *in* the Cloud**).

## 2. Key Services & Definitions

* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):** The primary service for **controlling access** to all AI/ML resources (like Amazon Bedrock or S3). It uses the **Principle of Least Privilege**, ensuring employees (users/roles) only have the minimal permissions needed to perform their job.
* **AWS Key Management Service (KMS):** Used to create and manage encryption keys, ensuring sensitive data (scripts, model artifacts) are protected both **at rest** (while stored in **Amazon S3**) and **in transit** (while moving between services).
* **Amazon CloudTrail:** Used for **auditing** and **governance**. It logs all API activity and actions taken by users or roles within your AWS account, providing a clear record of "who did what, where, and when."
* **Amazon GuardDuty:** A threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads, including those used by AI/ML systems.

## 3. Exam Focus & Key Concepts

### A. Shared Responsibility Model
The exam emphasizes understanding where AWS's responsibility ends and the customer's begins:

| Aspect | Responsibility | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security *of* the Cloud** | **AWS** | Protecting the physical data centers, global infrastructure, and foundational services (e.g., S3, EC2). |
| **Security *in* the Cloud** | **Customer** | Configuring **IAM policies**, encrypting customer data (scripts/models), and managing VPC network isolation. |

### B. Security Best Practices for AI/ML Workloads
* **Identity and Access Control:** Always use **IAM** to enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege**. Never grant users broad access they do not need.
* **Data Encryption:**
    * **At Rest:** Encrypt data stored in **Amazon S3** and model artifacts using **AWS KMS** keys.
    * **In Transit:** Ensure all communication between services (e.g., between an application and an Amazon Bedrock endpoint) uses **SSL/TLS (HTTPS)**.
* **Network Isolation:** Use **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** to launch and isolate services (like SageMaker or Bedrock fine-tuning jobs) in private subnets, ensuring sensitive data does not traverse the public internet. **AWS PrivateLink** is used to create a private, secure connection to AWS services within the VPC.
* **Logging and Auditing:** Use **Amazon CloudTrail** to maintain an audit trail of all AI/ML API calls for accountability and governance.

### C. Generative AI Security Considerations
Specific risks associated with Foundation Models:

* **Prompt Injection:** An attack where malicious input (prompt) tricks the model into performing unintended actions (e.g., revealing system prompts or sensitive information).
* **Data Poisoning:** An attack that corrupts the training data, degrading the model's accuracy or introducing backdoors/bias.
