**Q1. (D1.1) A model is trained to predict whether a customer will click a marketing email (Yes/No). This task uses data that has already been labeled with the correct outcome. Which type of learning is this?**
A. Unsupervised Learning
B. Reinforcement Learning
C. Supervised Learning
D. Deep Learning

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>
**Answer:** C. Supervised Learning
**Explanation:** Supervised learning is used when the data includes a target label or outcome (Yes/No), which the model uses to learn the relationship.

**Q2. (D1.2) A startup is developing a simple system to categorize incoming customer support tickets into one of three departments (Billing, Technical, or Sales). A developer suggests using a complex, custom-built Deep Learning model for the solution. Which principle suggests this approach is NOT appropriate?**
A. Inherent model bias
B. Cost-benefit analysis
C. Inaccuracy/Hallucination risk
D. Lack of compliance

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>
**Answer:** B. Cost-benefit analysis
**Explanation:** ML solutions are not appropriate when the cost-benefit analysis does not justify the complexity of the solution. If a simpler or existing method (like Amazon Comprehend or a simple classification model) can achieve the necessary accuracy, the complexity of a custom DL model is unjustified.

**Q3. (D1.3) In the ML development lifecycle, which stage involves normalizing, cleaning, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for the model?**
A. Model Evaluation
B. Data Collection
C. Feature Engineering and Pre-processing
D. Hyperparameter Tuning

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>
**Answer:** C. Feature Engineering and Pre-processing
**Explanation:** This stage, which includes data pre-processing and feature engineering, is where raw data is prepared, cleaned, and transformed into a dataset that improves model performance.

**Q4. (D1.2) Which AWS service provides pre-trained AI functionality for identifying objects, text, or faces in images and videos?**
A. Amazon Comprehend
B. Amazon Transcribe
C. Amazon Rekognition
D. Amazon Lex

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer and Explanation</strong></summary>
**Answer:** C. Amazon Rekognition
**Explanation:** Amazon Rekognition is the AWS managed AI service for Computer Vision (analyzing images/video). Amazon Comprehend handles text (NLP), Transcribe handles speech-to-text, and Lex handles conversational interfaces.
