# D1.2 ML Lifecycle (Domain 1: 20% Exam Weight)

## 1. Core Concept: The Media Company Analogy 🎬
**Analogy Focus:** The **ML Lifecycle** is the assembly line for creating a successful product, like an automated **Script Analyzer**.
1.  **Data Preparation:** The **Data Plumber (AWS Glue)** cleans and organizes all the raw market research from the **Infinite Warehouse (Amazon S3)**.
2.  **Training:** The model learns from the clean data.
3.  **Deployment:** The finished Script Analyzer is installed and ready for use.
4.  **Monitoring:** The **Supervisor (Amazon Augmented AI - A2I)** continually checks the analyzer's predictions to ensure it doesn't drift and keeps performing its job correctly.

## 2. Key Services & Definitions

* **Amazon S3 (The Infinite Warehouse):** Used in the **Data Collection** and **Data Preparation** stages as the scalable, durable storage for raw and processed datasets.
* **AWS Glue (The Data Plumber):** Used extensively in the **Data Preparation** stage for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks—cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering.
* **Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) (The Supervisor):** Used in the **Data Labeling** (part of Preparation) and **Monitoring** stages to implement human review workflows to ensure data quality and model accuracy.
* **Amazon QuickSight (The Graphic Designer):** Often used in the **Evaluation** and **Monitoring** stages to visualize model performance metrics, data drift, and business impact.

## 3. Exam Focus & Key Concepts

The ML Lifecycle is an iterative process typically broken down into these core stages:

### A. Stage 1: Problem Definition and Data Preparation
* **Business Goal:** Clearly define the objective (e.g., reduce customer churn, classify bad content).
* **Data Collection:** Gather raw data from sources (e.g., stored in **Amazon S3**).
* **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:** Clean, normalize, and transform data. This is where the **Data Plumber (AWS Glue)** is heavily used.
* **Data Labeling (If Supervised):** If the data is unlabeled, a human must manually tag the data. **The Supervisor (Amazon A2I)** can orchestrate these human review loops to ensure high-quality labeling.

### B. Stage 2: Model Training and Evaluation
* **Algorithm Selection:** Choose the best-suited ML algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Neural Network).
* **Training:** The model consumes the data, and its parameters are iteratively adjusted to minimize the error/loss function.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing parameters *outside* the model (like learning rate or number of layers) to improve performance.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on a held-out **validation set** using metrics relevant to the business goal (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).

### C. Stage 3: Deployment and Monitoring
* **Deployment (Hosting):** The trained model is packaged and hosted as an endpoint (often an API) to allow applications to request **inference** (predictions).
* **Model Monitoring:** The critical process of continually watching the deployed model to detect:
    * **Data Drift:** When new input data patterns differ significantly from the data the model was trained on.
    * **Model Drift (Concept Drift):** When the model’s prediction accuracy drops over time, requiring retraining.
    * **Amazon QuickSight** is often used to visualize these monitoring dashboards.
* **Retraining:** The process loops back to Stage 2 when drift is detected or new data becomes available.
