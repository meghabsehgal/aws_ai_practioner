# 🧠 Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning (20% Exam Weight)

This folder contains the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These are the core building blocks upon which all Generative AI services (like Amazon Bedrock) are built.

## Files in this Domain:

* **`1.1-AI-Concepts.md`**: Defines the hierarchy of AI, ML, and Deep Learning, and covers the three main learning approaches (Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning).
* **`1.2-ML-Lifecycle.md`**: Details the multi-stage process of creating an ML model, from Data Preparation (using AWS Glue) through Training, Deployment, and continuous Monitoring.

## Key Focus Areas:

* **Differentiating AI vs. ML vs. DL.**
* The function of **labeled** vs. **unlabeled** data.
* The primary stages and AWS services involved in the **ML Lifecycle**.
