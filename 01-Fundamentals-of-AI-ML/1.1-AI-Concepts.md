# D1.1 AI and ML Concepts (Domain 1: 20% Exam Weight)

## 1. Core Concept: The Media Company Analogy 🎬
**Analogy Focus:** This domain explains the three levels of intelligence:
1.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The **entire goal**—creating a system that can simulate human intelligence (e.g., the entire studio lot and all its smart systems).
2.  **Machine Learning (ML):** The **main method**—a way to achieve AI by training models to learn from historical data to make predictions (e.g., a **Script Analyzer** that learns which scripts succeed based on past box office data).
3.  **Deep Learning (DL):** A **specific technique**—a sophisticated ML method using large neural networks to handle complex, unstructured data like raw video or audio (e.g., the **Special Effects Guru** who processes raw footage and voice tracks automatically).

## 2. Key Services & Definitions: The AI/ML Hierarchy

| Concept | Definition | Analogy | AWS Service Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** | The broad discipline of creating machines that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. | The entire smart studio lot. | **Amazon Rekognition** (Computer Vision) |
| **ML (Machine Learning)** | A subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions, without explicit programming. | The Script Analyzer. | **Amazon SageMaker** (The ML Platform) |
| **DL (Deep Learning)** | A subset of ML that uses **Neural Networks** with many hidden layers to automatically extract features from complex, unstructured data. | The Special Effects Guru. | **Amazon Bedrock** (Used for LLMs, which are DL models) |
| **Neural Network** | A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). | The complex wiring within the Special Effects Guru's console. | N/A (Internal architecture) |

## 3. Exam Focus & Key Concepts

### A. Learning Methods
These methods describe how the ML model learns from data:

| Method | Data Type | Goal | AWS Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supervised Learning** | **Labeled Data** (Input paired with desired Output) | **Prediction** (e.g., predicting a continuous number) or **Classification** (e.g., predicting a category). | Predicting a house price (Regression) or classifying an email as Spam/Not Spam (Classification). |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | **Unlabeled Data** (Input only) | **Clustering** or discovering hidden patterns and structures in the data. | Segmenting customers into groups for marketing (Clustering). |
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | **No specific data**; learning through trial-and-error via **Rewards** and **Penalties** (feedback). | Optimizing a control system or making a sequence of decisions to maximize a long-term goal. | Optimizing the route for a delivery fleet (AWS DeepRacer). |

### B. The ML Process & Data Types
* **Training:** The iterative process where the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between its prediction and the actual, known outcome.
* **Inferencing (Prediction):** The process of using a **trained** model to make a prediction or decision on new, **unseen** data.
    * **Real-time Inference:** Used for immediate, low-latency predictions (e.g., fraud detection at the moment of a credit card swipe).
    * **Batch Inference:** Used for making predictions on large volumes of data at scheduled intervals (e.g., generating end-of-day sales forecasts).
* **Data Types:**
    * **Labeled Data:** Data where the answer (target) is known and attached to the input (required for Supervised Learning).
    * **Unlabeled Data:** Data without an attached answer (used for Unsupervised Learning and Foundational Model pre-training).
    * **Structured Data:** Organized data, typically in tables (rows and columns).
    * **Unstructured Data:** Data without a defined format (e.g., images, video, free-form text).
