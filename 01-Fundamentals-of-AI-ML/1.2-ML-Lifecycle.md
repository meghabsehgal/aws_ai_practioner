# 1.2 The ML Lifecycle (Domain 1: AI & ML Fundamentals)

## 1. Core Concept: The Media Company Analogy 🎬

The ML Lifecycle is how our **Media Company** makes a new movie or TV show. It's a structured process that ensures quality from the script to the final release.

* **1. Business Goal & Framing (The Pitch):** Why are we making this movie? (What problem are we solving?)
* **2. Data Processing (Pre-Production):** Gathering the raw footage, writing the script, casting the actors. (Sourcing, cleaning, and labeling data.)
* **3. Model Development (Production):** Shooting the movie, tweaking the scenes, editing the first cut. (Training, tuning, and evaluating the model.)
* **4. Deployment (The Premiere):** Launching the movie in theaters. (Making the model available for real-time predictions.)
* **5. Monitoring (Box Office Reviews):** Checking the reviews and ticket sales to see if it's successful. (Tracking model performance for drift/errors.)

## 2. Visual Diagram

A visual representation of the continuous feedback loop is essential for this topic.

## 3. Key Services & Definitions

This entire lifecycle is primarily managed by **Amazon SageMaker** ("The Lab") which provides tools for every single stage.

* **Problem Framing:** Identifying the use case. *Exam Focus: Understanding if ML is the right tool.*
* **Data Processing:** Using tools like **AWS Glue** (The Plumber) or **SageMaker Data Wrangler** to clean and prepare data. Data is typically stored in **Amazon S3** (The Warehouse).
* **Model Development:** **SageMaker Training** jobs are used here. The dataset is split into **Training, Validation, and Testing sets** (e.g., 70/20/10 split).
* **Monitoring & Maintenance:** **SageMaker Model Monitor** tracks performance in production for issues like **Data Drift** (the input data changes over time).

## 4. 🧠 Interactive Flashcard Quiz

<details>
<summary><strong>Q1: What is the primary AWS service used for managing all stages of the ML Lifecycle?</strong> (Click to check)</summary>

> **Answer:** **Amazon SageMaker**. It is the central platform for building, training, and deploying models on AWS.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q2: In which stage do you detect 'Data Drift'?</strong></summary>

> **Answer:** **Monitoring and Maintenance**. Data Drift occurs when the real-world data starts looking different from the training data, requiring the model to be retrained.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q3: In the analogy, what stage is represented by "Gathering the raw footage"?</strong></summary>

> **Answer:** **Data Processing** (Data Collection/Preparation).
