# D1.2 Identify Practical Use Cases for AI (Domain 1: 20% Exam Weight)

## 1. Value Proposition of AI/ML
[cite_start]AI/ML solutions provide value by assisting human decision making, offering solution scalability, and enabling automation[cite: 102].

## 2. Appropriate Use Cases
* [cite_start]**Computer Vision (CV):** Identifying objects, faces, or text in images/video (e.g., quality control in manufacturing)[cite: 105].
* [cite_start]**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding, generating, and translating human language (e.g., sentiment analysis, chatbots)[cite: 93, 105, 106].
* [cite_start]**Speech Recognition:** Converting audio into text (e.g., **Amazon Transcribe**)[cite: 105, 106].
* [cite_start]**Recommendation Systems:** Predicting user preference for products or content (e.g., **Amazon Personalize**)[cite: 105, 217].
* [cite_start]**Fraud Detection:** Identifying potentially fraudulent activities or transactions (e.g., **Amazon Fraud Detector**)[cite: 105, 217].
* [cite_start]**Forecasting:** Predicting future trends (e.g., sales, demand, time-series data)[cite: 95, 105].

## 3. When AI/ML is NOT Appropriate (Task 1.2 Objective)
[cite_start]AI/ML is generally **not appropriate** when[cite: 103]:
* A **specific, deterministic outcome** is required instead of a prediction.
* The **cost-benefit analysis** does not justify the complexity of an ML solution (e.g., if a simple IF/THEN rule achieves 99% of the required accuracy).
* There is **insufficient or poor quality data** available for training.

## 4. Key AWS Services for Pre-Trained AI
[cite_start]These managed services provide AI capabilities without requiring ML development[cite: 106]:
* **Amazon Transcribe:** Speech to text.
* **Amazon Translate:** Language translation.
* **Amazon Comprehend:** NLP for insights, sentiment, and key phrases.
* **Amazon Lex:** Building conversational interfaces (chatbots/voice).
* **Amazon Polly:** Text to lifelike speech.
