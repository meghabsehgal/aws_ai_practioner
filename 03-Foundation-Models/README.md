# 👑 Domain 3: Applications of Foundation Models (28% Exam Weight)

This is the **highest weighted domain** on the exam. It covers model selection, prompt engineering, customization methods (RAG/Fine-Tuning), the training process, and evaluation.

## Files in this Domain:

* [cite_start]**`3.1-Prompt-Engineering.md`**: The existing file name (which must cover Model Selection and Prompt Engineering)[cite: 144, 157].
* [cite_start]**`3.2-RAG-and-FineTuning.md`**: Compares the cost and effort tradeoffs of RAG and Fine-Tuning[cite: 154].
* [cite_start]**`3.3-FM-Training-Process.md`**: Describes pre-training, instruction tuning, and the data preparation for fine-tuning, including RLHF[cite: 163, 166, 168].
* [cite_start]**`3.4-FM-Evaluation-Metrics.md`**: Covers evaluation approaches and metrics like ROUGE and BLEU[cite: 172, 175].

## Key Focus Areas:

* The cost and complexity tradeoffs between RAG and Fine-Tuning.
* The purpose and application of Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting.
* Model evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BLEU) and their relation to business value.
