# D3.3 Training and Fine-Tuning Process (Domain 3: 28% Exam Weight)

## 1. Key Elements of Training a Foundation Model
[cite_start]Training involves several stages to create or adapt an FM[cite: 165]:
* **Pre-training:** Training a model on a massive, general dataset (e.g., the public internet) to learn fundamental language patterns. This is resource-intensive.
* **Fine-tuning:** Taking a pre-trained model and training it further on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt it to a downstream task or domain.
* **Continuous Pre-training:** Updating the model with new data as it becomes available to keep its knowledge current.

## 2. Methods for Fine-Tuning
[cite_start]Fine-tuning adapts the model's weights to improve performance on a specific task[cite: 167]:
* **Instruction Tuning:** Training the model to follow specific human instructions (e.g., "Summarize this article") instead of just predicting the next word.
* **Adapting Models for Specific Domains:** Training on domain-specific data (e.g., medical journals, financial reports) to improve knowledge recall and terminology use.
* **Transfer Learning:** The concept that knowledge gained from pre-training (on a large task) can be applied or *transferred* to a smaller, related task (fine-tuning).

## 3. Data Preparation for Fine-Tuning
[cite_start]Data preparation is critical and requires careful consideration[cite: 168]:
* **Data Curation and Governance:** Ensuring the data is clean, accurate, and adheres to organizational policies.
* **Size and Labeling:** Fine-tuning requires smaller, high-quality, **labeled** datasets (in contrast to the massive, often unlabeled data used for pre-training).
* **Representativeness:** The fine-tuning dataset must accurately represent the scenarios the model will encounter in production to avoid bias.
* [cite_start]**RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** A method where human preferences (ratings of model responses) are used to further adjust the model's weights, making its outputs more helpful and harmless[cite: 168].
