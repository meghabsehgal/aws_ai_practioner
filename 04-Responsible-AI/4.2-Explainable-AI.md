# D4.2 Transparent and Explainable Models (Domain 4: 14% Exam Weight)

## 1. Transparency vs. Explainability
* **Transparency:** Refers to the clarity of the AI system itself (e.g., open source code, documentation, clear licensing)[cite: 193, 194].
* **Explainability (XAI):** The degree to which a human can understand the inner workings and rationale behind an AI decision (a justification for the output)[cite: 193].
* **Tradeoffs:** There is often a tradeoff between model safety and transparency. Highly optimized models are often less explainable, while simpler, more transparent models may have lower performance[cite: 195].

## 2. Tools and Practices for Transparency and Explainability
* **Amazon SageMaker Model Cards:** A tool to document the model's intended use, performance metrics, training data, and fairness assessments, thereby increasing transparency[cite: 194].
* **Open Source Models and Data:** Using open source components makes the underlying mechanism more transparent to auditors[cite: 194].
* **Human-Centered Design:** Designing AI interfaces so that the human end-user can easily understand how the AI's suggestion or decision was reached[cite: 196].

## 3. Task Statement 4.1 Review: Responsibility and Ethics
* **Features of Responsible AI:** Bias, fairness, safety, veracity, and inclusivity[cite: 180].
* **Tools for Monitoring:** **Amazon SageMaker Clarify** and **SageMaker Model Monitor** are used to detect and monitor bias and trustworthiness during and after training[cite: 187].
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** **Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)** is used to route low-confidence predictions to human reviewers to improve fairness and accuracy[cite: 187].
