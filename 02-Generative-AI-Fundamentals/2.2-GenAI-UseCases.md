# D2.2 Generative AI Use Cases (Domain 2: 24% Exam Weight)

## 1. Core Concept: The Media Company Analogy 🎬
**Analogy Focus:** Generative AI use cases are the **various roles** the **Genius Writer (Amazon Bedrock)** can fulfill for the media company:
* **Script Summarizer:** Reading lengthy historical documents and extracting key plot points.
* **Junior Coder:** Writing simple software tools and scripts for the production team.
* **Concept Artist:** Creating initial visual concepts for new movie posters or character designs.
* **Customer Service Bot:** Handling routine inquiries about showtimes or ticket prices.

## 2. Key Services & Definitions

* **Amazon Bedrock (The Genius Writer):** The centralized service used to deploy and access the Foundation Models (FMs) that perform these generative tasks (e.g., Anthropic Claude, Stability AI Stable Diffusion).
* **Amazon CodeWhisperer (The Junior Coder):** A specialized Generative AI service that directly assists developers by generating code suggestions in real-time, focusing specifically on the **Code Generation** use case.
* **Amazon Polly:** An AI service that turns text into lifelike speech, relevant to the **Audio/Voice Generation** use case.
* **Amazon Transcribe:** A service that converts speech to text, which is often used in the ML data pipeline to prepare large volumes of audio data before FMs use it for summarization or analysis.

## 3. Exam Focus & Key Use Cases

Generative AI use cases are typically divided by modality (type of data they create):

### A. Text and Code Generation (LLM Use Cases)
This is the most common application of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via Amazon Bedrock.
* **Content Generation:** Drafting marketing copy, writing internal documentation, generating personalized customer emails, or assisting in creative writing.
* **Summarization and Abstraction:** Automatically condensing long articles, legal documents, or meeting transcripts.
* **Question Answering (Q&A):** Providing conversational answers to customer or employee questions, often enhanced by RAG for accuracy.
* **Code Generation:** Writing boilerplate code, completing functions, generating unit tests, or translating code between programming languages (e.g., using **Amazon CodeWhisperer**).
* **Chatbots/Virtual Assistants:** Providing immediate, human-like interaction for customer support or internal help desks.

### B. Image and Media Generation (Vision Use Cases)
* **Text-to-Image Generation:** Creating completely new images based on a natural language prompt (e.g., "a golden robot hiking on Mars"). This is revolutionary for marketing and concept art.

* **Image Editing/Inpainting:** Removing or adding specific elements to an existing image (e.g., removing a logo from a product photo).
* **Data Augmentation:** Generating synthetic images or data to expand a dataset for training other models, especially when real data is scarce.

### C. Cross-Modal Use Cases
* **Search and Retrieval:** Using embeddings from a text model to perform semantic search, finding documents based on meaning rather than just keywords.
* **Translation:** Translating text (or speech) into different languages while preserving context and tone.
* **Voice and Audio Generation:** Creating realistic voiceovers from text (**Amazon Polly**) or composing background music.
