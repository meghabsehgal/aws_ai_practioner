# ✨ Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI (24% Exam Weight)

This domain focuses on the core concepts, architecture, capabilities, limitations, and the AWS services used to build Generative AI applications.

## Files in this Domain:

* **`2.1-GenAI-Concepts.md`**: Covers foundational concepts (tokens, embeddings, transformer-based LLMs, foundation models) and the FM lifecycle[cite: 125, 127].
* **`2.2-GenAI-Limitations.md`**: Describes the advantages and disadvantages of GenAI (hallucinations, nondeterminism) and factors for model selection[cite: 130, 131, 132].
* **`2.3-GenAI-AWS-Infra.md`**: Identifies AWS services (Bedrock, SageMaker JumpStart, Amazon Q) and describes the cost tradeoffs and infrastructure advantages[cite: 139, 142].

## Key Focus Areas:

* Understanding Tokenization, Embeddings, and Vectors.
* Recognizing risks like Hallucinations and Inaccuracy.
* Cost analysis for token-based versus provisioned throughput pricing.
