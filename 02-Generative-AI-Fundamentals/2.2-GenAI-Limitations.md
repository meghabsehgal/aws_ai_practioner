# D2.2 Capabilities and Limitations of Generative AI (Domain 2: 24% Exam Weight)

## 1. Advantages of Generative AI (Capabilities)
Generative AI offers several business advantages[cite: 130]:
* **Adaptability:** FMs can be fine-tuned or adapted via RAG for various tasks across different domains[cite: 130].
* **Responsiveness:** FMs can quickly generate high-quality, long-form content.
* **Simplicity:** Accessing FMs via services like Amazon Bedrock lowers the barrier to entry compared to building custom ML models[cite: 140].

## 2. Disadvantages of Generative AI (Limitations)
Generative AI solutions present inherent disadvantages[cite: 131]:
* **Hallucinations:** The model generating factually incorrect but plausible-sounding information.
* **Inaccuracy:** The model producing irrelevant or low-quality content based on poor prompts or insufficient context.
* **Nondeterminism:** The same prompt can produce different outputs, making repeatability difficult.
* **Interpretability (Explainability):** It can be difficult to explain *why* an FM produced a specific output (a "black box" problem)[cite: 131, 193].

## 3. Factors for Generative AI Model Selection
Factors to consider when selecting an appropriate generative AI model include[cite: 132]:
* **Model Types (Architecture):** Transformer, Diffusion, etc.
* **Performance Requirements:** Latency, accuracy, and throughput.
* **Capabilities & Constraints:** Input/output length, multi-modality support (text, image, audio), and cost.
* **Compliance:** Meeting data residency and governance requirements[cite: 132].

## 4. Determining Business Value
Business value and metrics for GenAI applications often focus on efficiency and user experience[cite: 133]:
* **Efficiency:** Time saved per user, automation rates.
* **Financial:** Conversion rate, average revenue per user (ARPU), customer lifetime value (CLV).
* **Performance:** Accuracy and cross-domain performance.
