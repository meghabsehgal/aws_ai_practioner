# D2.3 AWS Infrastructure for Generative AI (Domain 2: 24% Exam Weight)

## 1. Key AWS Services for Generative AI Applications
AWS provides various services to build and deploy GenAI solutions[cite: 139]:
* **Amazon Bedrock:** Provides a unified API to access various Foundation Models (FMs), including those from Amazon (Titan) and third parties (Anthropic, Stability AI).
* **Amazon SageMaker JumpStart:** A hub for pre-trained FMs, algorithms, and solutions that can be quickly deployed on SageMaker infrastructure.
* **Amazon Q:** A generative AI-powered assistant that uses proprietary data to answer questions about business, code, or data.
* **PartyRock:** A no-code playground for quickly experimenting with Amazon Bedrock FMs.

## 2. Advantages of Using AWS Generative AI Services
Using AWS for GenAI offers several benefits[cite: 140, 141]:
* **Accessibility & Lower Barrier to Entry:** Services like Bedrock simplify access to FMs without managing complex infrastructure.
* **Efficiency & Speed to Market:** Quickly prototype and deploy GenAI applications.
* **Security & Compliance:** Leveraging AWS infrastructure benefits, including the shared responsibility model, security features, and compliance certifications.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Using consumption-based pricing models (token-based pricing).

## 3. Cost Tradeoffs of AWS Generative AI Services
Cost considerations vary based on the service and usage model[cite: 142]:
* **Token-Based Pricing:** Pay-per-use, common for standard Bedrock model access. Cost scales with the length of the input (prompt) and output (completion).
* **Provisioned Throughput:** Purchasing a fixed rate of throughput (tokens per second) for a period. This is often more cost-effective for high-volume, low-latency production applications.
* **Custom Models:** Fine-tuned models incur additional costs for the training job and dedicated hosting (provisioned throughput or dedicated endpoints).
